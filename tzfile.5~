.TH TZFILE 5
.SH NAME
tzfile \- time zone information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
#include "tzfile.h"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The time zone information files used by
.IR settz (3)
and
.IR newlocaltime (3)
have the format of the
.I tzinfo
structure described in the include file
.B 
"tzfile.h":
.sp
.nf
.in +.5i
.ta .5i +\w'struct dsinfo  'u
struct dsinfo {
	long	ds_gmtoff;
	char	ds_abbr[TZ_ABBR_LEN+1];
	char	ds_isdst;
};

struct tzinfo {
	int	tz_timecnt;
	long	tz_times[TZ_MAX_TIMES];
	char	tz_types[TZ_MAX_TIMES];
	struct dsinfo	tz_dsinfo[TZ_MAX_TYPES];
};
.fi
.PP
The
.B tz_timecnt
field tells how many of the
.B tz_times
and
.B tz_types
stored in the file are meaningful.
Each of the meaningful
.B tz_times
entries is a starting time (as returned by
.IR time (2));
the same-indexed
.B tz_types
entry is the index of the
.B tz_dsinfo
array element that tells about how "local time" is generated starting at that
time.
For a file to be used by
.IR settz ,
its
.B tz_times
entries must be sorted in ascending order.
.PP
In the
.B tz_dsinfo
structures,
.B ds_gmtoff
gives the number of seconds that should be added to GMT;
.B ds_abbr
is the ASCII-NUL-terminated string used as the time zone abbreviation;
and
.B
ds_isdst
tells whether
.B
tm_isdst
should be set by
.IR newlocaltime (3).
.PP
.I Newlocaltime
uses the first element of
.B tz_dsinfo
if either
.B tz_timecnt
is zero or
.IR newlocaltime 's
argument is less than
.BR tz_times[0] .
