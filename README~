The basic idea is to have a system-wide directory that contains binary files
describing time zone rules; functions such as "localtime" could read such
files before doing time conversions.

A manual page for a "time zone compiler" that turns text-file descriptions of
time zone rules into binary files is also included, as is a sample input file
for the compiler.  These would, of course, not be part of the standard;
they are included here only to show that the binary files that would be used
under this scheme can be readily created.

Source code for these functions and for the time zone compiler are available
from seismo!elsie!ado, the person to whom to direct comments.
