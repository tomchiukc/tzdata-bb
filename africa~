# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-06-25):
# Mauritius plans to observe DST from 2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31 on a trial

# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to

# http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/mauritius-daylight-saving-time.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to

# </a>
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time:  Energy conservation?"-# No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'ete" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one.

# Cabinet Decision of July 18th, 2008 states as follows:
#
# 4. ...Cabinet has agreed to the introduction into the National Assembly
# of the Time Bill which provides for the introduction of summer time in

# the standard time, will be aligned with that in Europe and the United

# last Sunday of October and will end at two o'clock in the morning on
# the last Sunday of March the following year. The summer time for the

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-10):
# The infomediaire.ma source indicates that the system is to be in
# effect every year. It gives 03H00 as the "fall back" time of day;
# it lacks a "spring forward" time of day; assume 2:00 XXX.
# Wait on specifying the Ramadan exception for details about
# start date, start time of day, end date, and end time of day XXX.

# From Petronella Sibeene (2007-03-30) in
# <http://allafrica.com/stories/200703300178.html>:
# While the entire country changes its time, Katima Mulilo and other
# settlements in Caprivi unofficially will not because the sun there
# rises and sets earlier compared to other regions.  Chief of
# Forecasting Riaan van Zyl explained that the far eastern parts of
# the country are close to 40 minutes earlier in sunrise than the rest
# of the country.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-31):
# Apparently the Caprivi Strip informally observes Botswana time, but
# we have no details.  In the meantime people there can use Africa/Gaborone.
