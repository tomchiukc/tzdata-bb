# According to a December, 1986 letter from kre:
# "Turns out to have been premature, I gather SA has changed its mind,
# and isn't going to have EST anywhere now, so the West-SA and East-SA
# distinction isn't needed...  They're staying GMT+9:30 all over.
# I will try and find out what they're doing with DST, but it probably
# won't be easy, I suspect that they have no idea..."

# So. . .we'll comment out these next four lines:
# Zone	Australia/East-SA	9:30	Oz	CST	1987 Mar Sun<=21 3:00
# 				10:00	Oz	EST
# Zone	Australia/West-SA	9:30	Oz	CST	1987 Mar Sun<=21 3:00
# 				10:00	-	EST
# . . .and stay with:
Zone	Australia/South		9:30	Oz	CST

# Victoria and New South Wales made the jump to a later ending date for
# DST in 1986 rather than 1987.  New South Wales also had another variation
# in 1983, but the details of that are unknown to the authors at this time.
