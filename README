This 1989 update of the time zone package features POSIXization (including
interpretation of POSIX-style TZ environment variables, provided by Guy
Harris), ANSIfication (including a version of "mktime"), corrections to some
time zone data (including corrections to the rules for Great Britain and
New Zealand), reference data from the United States Naval Observatory for
folks who want to do additional time zones, and the 1989 data for Saudi Arabia.

Please send comments or information to ado@ncifcrf.gov.

Be sure to read the comments in "Makefile" and make any changes
needed to make things right for your system.

To use the new functions, use a "-lz" option when compiling or linking.

Historical local time information has been included here not because it
is particularly useful, but rather to:

*	give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
	expected in the future;

*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
	system.

The information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;
if you know that the rules are different from those in a file, by all means
feel free to change file (and please send the changed version to
ado@ncifcrf.gov for use in the future).  Europeans take note!

Folks who've made major contributions to the time zone package include
Keith Bostic, Bob Devine, Robert Elz, Guy Harris, John Mackin, Mark Horton,
and Bradley White.  None of them are responsible for the remaining errors.
