who are responsible for any good ideas that show up here).

If you're *really* adventurous, you can put ctime.o in /lib/libc.a--
conservative soul that I am, I'd recommend against it.

This version of the time zone software uses a new format (provided by sun!guy)
for the time zone information files.  They are now stored by default in a
directory named "/etc/zoneinfo" rather than "/etc/tzdir" or "/etc/timezones".
as before.  If you've already compiled programs with older time zone software,
just leave the "/etc/tzdir" and/or "/etc/timezones" files around until you
have a chance to recompile.

Historical local time information has been included here not because it
is particularly useful, but rather to:

*	give people an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
	expected in the future;

*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
	system.
