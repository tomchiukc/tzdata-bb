carbon copes to cbosgd!mark, seismo!linus!encore!necis!geo, and
seismo!munnari!kre, who are responsible for any good ideas that show up here).

Historical local time information has been included here not because it
is particularly useful, but rather to:

*	give people an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
	expected in the future;

*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
	system.

The "ctime.c" source file does conversion of old-style calls to new-style calls;
when you do a
	make
both "ctime.o" and "settz.o" are archived in "/usr/lib/libtz.a" so that you can
recompile old code a la
	cc ... -ltz
to use the new functions.  If you're *really* adventuresome, you can put ctime.o
and settz.o in the C library--conservative soul that I am, I'd recommend
against it.
