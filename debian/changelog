tzdata-au (2008b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use symlinks to corrected timezone information rather than using
    dpkg-divert. Triggers are now used because dpkg fails to unpack
    hardlinks that are diverted (bug #245322), which caused tzdata
    upgrades to fail when tzdata-au was installed.
  * Remove build-dependency on quilt.
  * Update debhelper version to 8.
  * Update standards-version to 3.9.1, no changes.

tzdata-au (2008b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split into a separate tzdata-au add-on package.

tzdata (2008b-1au1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct Australian timezone names:
    - Prefix most with 'A' (except islands & LMT).
    - Use 'D' for daylight saving time and 'S' for standard time.
