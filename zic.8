.I Zic
reads text from the file(s) named on the command line
and creates the time zone information files specified in this input.
If a
.I filename
is
.BR ` - ',
the standard input is read.
.PP
A sharp characters (#) in the input introduces a comment which extends to
the end of the line the sharp character appears on.
Any line which is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.
Non-blank lines are expected to be of one of three
types:  rule lines, zone lines, and link lines.
.PP
A rule line has the form
.nf
.B
.ti +.5i
.ta \w'Rule 'u +\w'MostNA 'u +\w'FROM 'u +\w'1973 'u +\w'TYPE 'u +\w'Apr 'u +\w'lastSun 'u +\w'2:00 'u +\w'SAVE 'u
.sp
Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S
.sp
For example:
.ti +.5i
.sp
Rule	MostNA	1969	1973	-	Apr	lastSun	2:00	1:00	D
.sp
.fi
The fields that make up a rule line are:
.TP
.B NAME
Gives the (arbitrary) name of the set of rules this rule is part of.
.TP
.B FROM
Gives the first year in which the rule applies.
.TP
.B TO
Gives the last year in which the rule applies.
.TP
.B TYPE
Gives the type of year in which the year applies.  If
.B TYPE
is
.B
"-"
then the rule is taken to apply in all years between
.B FROM
and
.B TO
inclusive.
If
.B TYPE
is something else, then the command
.B
.ti +.5i
years from to type
.br
is executed with arguments
.IR from ,
.IR to ,
and
.IR type
taken from the rule line; the rule is taken to apply only in those years
printed by the
.I years
command.

The distributed
.I years
command is a shell script that can handle year types
.B uspres
(United States presidential election years)
and
.B nonpres
(all other years);
other year types may be added by changing the script.
.TP
.B IN
Names the month in which the rule takes effect.  Month names may be
abbreviated.
.TP
.B ON
Gives the day on which the rule takes effect.
Recognized forms include:
.nf
.in +.5i
.sp
.ta \w'lastSun  'u
5	the fifth of the month
lastSun	the last Sunday in the month
lastMon	the last Monday in the month
Sun>=8	first Sunday on or after the eighth
Sun<=25	last Sunday on or before the 25th
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
Names of days of the week may be abbreviated or spelled out in full.
Note that there must be no spaces within the
.B ON
field 
(or within any other field).
.TP
.B AT
Gives the time of day at which the rule takes affect.
Recognized forms include:
.nf
.in +.5i
.sp
.ta \w'1:28:13  'u
2	time in hours
2:00	time in hours and minutes
15:00	24-hour format time (for times after noon)
1:28:14	time in hours, minutes, and seconds
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp
where hour 0 is midnight at the start of the day,
and hour 24 is midnight at the end of the day.
Any of these forms may be followed by the letter
.B w
if the given time is local
.q "wall clock"
time,
.B s
if the given time is local
.q "standard"
time, or
.B u
(or
.B g
or
.BR z )
if the given time is universal time;
in the absence of an indicator,
wall clock time is assumed.
.TP
.B SAVE
Gives the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule is in
effect.  This field has the same format as the
.B AT
field.
.TP
.B LETTER/S
Gives the
.q "variable part"
(for example, the
.q "S"
or
.q "D"
in
.q "EST"
or
.q "EDT" )
of time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule is in effect.
If this field is
.B
"-",
the variable part is null.
.PP
A zone line has the form
.sp
.nf
.ti +.5i
.ta \w'Zone 'u +\w'Eastern 'u +\w'GMTOFF 'u +\w'MostNA 'u
Zone	NAME	GMTOFF	RULES	FORMAT
.sp
For example:
.sp
.ti +.5i
Zone	Australia/Adelaide	9:30	Aus	AC%sT	1971 Oct 31  2:00
.sp
.fi
The fields that make up a zone line are:
.TP
.B NAME
The name of the time zone.
This is the name used in creating the time zone information file for the zone.
.TP
.B GMTOFF
The amount of time to add to GMT to get standard time in this zone.
This field has the same format as the
.B AT
and
.B SAVE
fields of rule lines;
begin the field with a minus sign if time must be subtracted from GMT.
.TP
.B RULES
The name of the rule(s) that apply in the time zone.
If this field contains
.B
"-"
then standard time always applies in the time zone.
.TP
.B FORMAT
The format for time zone abbreviations in this time zone.
The pair of characters
.B %s
is used to show where the
.q "variable part"
of the time zone abbreviation goes.
Alternately,
a slash (/)
separates standard and daylight abbreviations.
.TP
.B UNTILYEAR [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]]
The time at which the UT offset or the rule(s) change for a location.
It is specified as a year, a month, a day, and a time of day.
If this is specified,
the time zone information is generated from the given UT offset
and rule change until the time specified.
The month, day, and time of day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT
fields of a rule; trailing fields can be omitted, and default to the
earliest possible value for the missing fields.
.IP
The next line must be a
.q "continuation"
line; this has the same form as a zone line except that the
string
.q "Zone"
and the name are omitted, as the continuation line will
place information starting at the time specified as the
.q "until"
information in the previous line in the file used by the previous line.
Continuation lines may contain
.q "until"
information, just as zone lines do, indicating that the next line is a further
continuation.
.PP
A link line has the form
.sp
.nf
.ti +.5i
.ta \w'Link 'u +\w'Eastern 'u
Link	FROM	TO
.sp
For example:
.sp
.ti +.5i
Link	Eastern		EST5EDT
.sp
.fi
The
.B FROM
field should appear as the
.B NAME
field in some zone line;
the
.B TO
field is used as an alternate name for that zone.
.PP
Except for continuation lines,
lines may appear in any order in the input.
However, the behavior is unspecified if multiple zone or link lines
define the same name, or if the source of one link line is the target
of another.
.PP
Lines in the file that describes leap seconds have the following form:
.nf
.ti +.5i
.ta \w'Leap\0\0'u +\w'YEAR\0\0'u +\w'MONTH\0\0'u +\w'DAY\0\0'u +\w'HH:MM:SS\0\0'u +\w'CORR\0\0'u
.sp
Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S
.sp
For example:
.ti +.5i
.sp
Leap	1974	Dec	31	23:59:60	+	S
.sp
.fi
The
.BR YEAR ,
.BR MONTH ,
.BR DAY ,
and
.B HH:MM:SS
fields tell when the leap second happened.
The
.B CORR
field
should be
.q "+"
if a second was added
or
.q "-"
if a second was skipped.
.\" There's no need to document the following, since it's impossible for more
.\" than one leap second to be inserted or deleted at a time.
.\" The C Standard is in error in suggesting the possibility.
.\" See Terry J Quinn, The BIPM and the accurate measure of time,
.\" Proc IEEE 79, 7 (July 1991), 894-905.
.\"	or
.\"	.q ++
.\"	if two seconds were added
.\"	or
.\"	.q --
.\"	if two seconds were skipped.
The
.B R/S
field
should be (an abbreviation of)
.q "Stationary"
if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as UTC
or
(an abbreviation of)
.q "Rolling"
if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as
local wall clock time.

In this example, the zone is named Europe/Zurich but it has an alias

as Switzerland.  This example says that Zurich was 34 minutes and 8
seconds west of UT until 1853-07-16 at 00:00, when the legal offset
was changed to 7\(de\|26\(fm\|22.50\(sd; although this works out to
0:29:45.50, the input format cannot represent fractional seconds so it
is rounded here.  After 1894-06-01 at 00:00 Swiss daylight saving rules
(defined with lines beginning with "Rule Swiss") apply, and the UT offset
became one hour.  From 1981 to the present, EU daylight saving rules have
applied, and the UTC offset has remained at one hour.
.PP
In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from the first Monday
in May at 01:00 to the first Monday in October at 02:00.
The pre-1981 EU daylight-saving rules have no effect
here, but are included for completeness.  Since 1981, daylight
saving has begun on the last Sunday in March at 01:00 UTC.
Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at 01:00 UTC,
but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in 1996.
.PP
For purposes of
display, "LMT" and "BMT" were initially used, respectively.  Since
Swiss rules and later EU rules were applied, the display name for the
time zone has been CET for standard time and CEST for daylight saving
time.
.SH NOTES
For areas with more than two types of local time,
you may need to use local standard time in the
.B AT
field of the earliest transition time's rule to ensure that
the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is correct.
.PP
If,
for a particular zone,
a clock advance caused by the start of daylight saving
coincides with and is equal to
a clock retreat caused by a change in UT offset,
.IR zic
produces a single transition to daylight saving at the new UT offset
(without any change in wall clock time).
To get separate transitions
use multiple zone continuation lines
specifying transition instants using universal time.
.PP
Time stamps well before the Big Bang are silently omitted from the output.
This works around bugs in software that mishandles large negative time
stamps.  Call it sour grapes, but pre-Big-Bang time stamps are
physically suspect anyway.  The pre-Big-Bang cutoff time is
approximate and may change in future versions.
