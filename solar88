# Apparent noon times below are for Riyadh; they're a bit off for other places.
# Times were computed using formulas in the U.S. Naval Observatory's
# Almanac for Computers 1988; the formulas "will give EqT to an accuracy of
# [plus or minus] two seconds during the current year."
#
# Rounding to the nearest five seconds results in fewer than
# 256 different "time types"--a limit that's faced because time types are
# stored on disk as unsigned chars.
