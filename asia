# Incorporates data for Singapore from Robert Elz' asia 1.1, as well as
# additional information from Tom Yap, Sun Microsystems Intercontinental
# Technical Support (including a page from the Official Airline Guide -
# Worldwide Edition).  The names for time zones are guesses.

# From Guy Harris:
# People's Republic of China.  Yes, they really have only one time zone.

# From Bob Devine:
# No they don't.  See TIME mag, February 17, 1986 p.52.  Even though
# China is across 4 physical time zones, before Feb 1, 1986 only the
# Peking (Bejing) time zone was recognized.  Since that date, China
# has two of 'em -- Peking's and Urumqi (named after the capital of
# the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region).  I don't know about DST for it.
# 
# Ooops. I just deleted the DST table and this editor makes it too
# painful to suck in another copy..  So, here is what I have for 
# DST start/end dates for Peking's time zone (info from AP):
# 
#     1986 May 4 - Sept 14
#     1987 mid-April - ?? 

# From the U.S. Naval Observatory (as of 2/10/88):
# 	CHINA               8 H AHEAD OF UTC; ALL OF CHINA, INCL TAIWAN 

# From Arthur David Olson:
# While further research gets done, we'll stick with one time zone. . .
